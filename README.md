## Project 1: Sustainability Analysis of Fast Fashion Brands

Using company and user tweets, running a sentiment analysis about fast fashion brands' sustainability practices. The project aims to understand the consumer sentiment about a brand's sustainability practices and if a brand can use social media as a tool to gauge user sentiment in the context of environmental practices. For this analysis we chose to analyze the top fast fashion brands in Canada; H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, and SHEIN. To act as a comparative metric, we included Patagonia to the list, a brand built on sustainable values.

## Project 2: Integer Optimization to solve Supply Demand Gap for BIXI
At the operational level, BIXI (bike sharing service in Montreal) faces bike trip demands that are severely spatially and temporally asymmetric, driven by commuting patterns in the city. Our goal is to identify a strategy that allows Bixi to relocate the optimal number of bikes, between the optimal set of stations around the city, at a specific point in time. By moving the bikes from the stations with the highest demand to the stations with the low demand, more users will be able to access Bixi’s service, thus increasing the company’s profit and customer satisfaction.
