## [1. Understanding Risk Factor in Automobile Insurance using Random Forests](https://github.com/teghwin404/predicting-insurance-risk.git)
Insurance companies are constantly looking for ways to accurately assess the risk of insuring different vehicles. This is important, as it allows them to set appropriate premiums and ensure that they can cover potential losses. This project presents a statistical analysis that uses machine learning to predict the risk rating of automobiles based on their characteristics. More specifically, it will investigate the affect of a car’s specifications on the assigned insurance risk rating (symbol) of a vehicle which is a significant factor when calculating insurance premiums. This analysis will not only assist insurance companies but also help consumers become more aware about the key drivers of their insurance rates.

Tools used: R Studio, Random Forests, Boosted Forests, PCA, Clustering, GG Plot

## [2. Linear Optimization to solve Supply-Demand Mismatch for Bike Sharing Service](https://github.com/teghwin404/bike-relocation-optimization.git)

Public bike sharing services often face an unbalanced distribution of bikes among the stations across the city. As users tend to follow specific destination flows when going to work, school, or other daily activities (mainly moving from residential areas to downtown in the morning, and vice-versa in the afternoon), many stations with a high demand for bikes end up being full, which stops other users from being able to dock their bicycles at their destination.)

The final objective was to develop a model which suggests the optimal bike relocating strategy around the city, and consequently allowing more customers to utilize the service. In order to do so, a linear optimization model was built which relocates bikes from stations with lower demand to stations observing relatively higher demands.

Tools Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook), Gurobi for Programming, Numpy, MatplotLib

## [3. Interactive Dashboard for Sports Management Company](https://github.com/teghwin404/sports-data-visualization.git)
Using Tableau, this project utilizes a large hockey player dataset to find insights for CKM; a sports management company. The dataset included information about 7000+ players organized by leagues and teams. Some of the variables included metrics like goals, time on ice, games played, number of faceoffs, etc. The dataset included players from Canada, US, Sweden, Finland, and Russia.

The dashboard assisted the company in identifying high-performing players across 34 hockey teams. Boxplots, treemaps, bar charts, graphs were used to identify players based on their performance. Interactive filters were developed for the company so they can set cutoffs when signing up new players. The dashboard also facilated easy retreival of individual players while also providing an overview of averages. Custom KPIs like scoring accuracy and consistency were added to improve the richness of the analysis. The dashboard helped CKM filter and visualize all the player metric

Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

## [4. Sentiment Analysis of Fast Fashion Brands using Twitter Data](https://github.com/teghwin404/sustainability-analysis-using-tweets.git)
Using company and user tweets, running a sentiment analysis about fast fashion brands' sustainability practices. The project aims to understand the consumer sentiment about a brand's sustainability practices and if a brand can use social media as a tool to gauge user sentiment in the context of environmental practices. For this analysis we chose to analyze the top fast fashion brands in Canada; H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, and SHEIN. To act as a comparative metric, we included Patagonia to the list, a brand built on sustainable values.

Tools Used: Python, Text Scraping, Find and Replace, Sentiment Analysis, Word Frequency, Excel
