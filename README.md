## [1. Understanding Risk Factor in Automobile Insurance using Random Forests](https://github.com/teghwin404/predicting-insurance-risk.git)
#### Tools used: R Studio, Random Forests, Boosted Forests, PCA, Clustering, GG Plot

Insurance companies are constantly looking for ways to accurately assess the risk of insuring different vehicles. This is important, as it allows them to set appropriate premiums and ensure that they can cover potential losses. This project presents a statistical analysis that uses machine learning to predict the risk rating of automobiles based on their characteristics. More specifically, it investigates the affect of a carâ€™s specifications on the assigned insurance risk rating (symbol) of a vehicle which is a significant factor when calculating insurance premiums. This analysis not only assists insurance companies but can also help consumers become more aware about the key drivers of their insurance rates.

## [2. Mixed Integer Programming to solve Supply-Demand Mismatch for Bike Sharing Service](https://github.com/teghwin404/bike-relocation-optimization.git)
#### Tools Used: Python (Jupyter Notebook), Gurobi for Programming, Numpy, MatplotLib

Public bike sharing services often face an unbalanced distribution of bikes among the stations across the city. As users tend to follow specific destination flows when going to work, school, or other daily activities (mainly moving from residential areas to downtown in the morning, and vice-versa in the afternoon), many stations with a high demand for bikes end up being full, which stops other users from being able to dock their bicycles at their destination). The objective of the project was to develop a model which suggests the optimal bike relocating strategy around the city, and consequently allowing more customers to utilize the service. In order to do so, a mixed integer optimization model was built which relocates bikes from stations with lower demand to stations observing relatively higher demands.

## [3. Interactive Dashboard for Sports Management Company](https://github.com/teghwin404/sports-data-visualization.git)
#### Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

Using Tableau, this project utilizes a 7000+ hockey players dataset to find insights for CKM; a sports management company. The dashboard assisted the company in identifying high-performing players across 34 hockey teams. Boxplots, treemaps, bar charts, graphs were used to identify players based on their performance. Interactive filters were developed for the company so they can set cutoffs when signing up new players. The dashboard also facilated easy retreival of individual players while also providing an overview of averages. Custom KPIs like scoring accuracy and consistency were added to improve the richness of the analysis.

## [4. Sentiment Analysis of Fast Fashion Brands using Twitter Data](https://github.com/teghwin404/sustainability-analysis-using-tweets.git)
#### Tools Used: Python, Text Scraping, Find and Replace, Sentiment Analysis, Word Frequency, Excel 

Using company and user tweets, running a sentiment analysis about fast fashion brands' sustainability practices. The project aims to understand the consumer sentiment about a brand's sustainability practices and if a brand can use social media as a tool to gauge user sentiment in the context of environmental practices. For this analysis we chose to analyze the top fast fashion brands in Canada; H&M, Zara, Uniqlo, and SHEIN. To act as a comparative metric, we included Patagonia to the list, a brand built on sustainable values.
